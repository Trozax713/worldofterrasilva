        <h1>Saiorse</h1>
        <p>The egg that would hatch Saiorse was laid in the region known as the Shattered peaks. Though she doesn't now know it, that egg was stolen by poachers. From there they journeyed all the way along the coast of the Emerald Highlands looking for a buyer. They went to Fenrir's Hollow to trade this egg for some exotic materials. During that journey they somehow lost track of the egg and it hatched, a young Saiorse emerges. 
        <br><br>
        She is found by the members of the White Fang clan, a group of wolf tamers who have raised her as one of them. Being Dragonborn, she has grown quickly to the age of 16.
