        <h1>Hawk</h1>
        <p>Born to the White Fang clan, Hawk was raised to respect the bond between people and beast. As is the tradition among the White Fang, Hawk was tasked with the trail of forming a bond with one of the mighty wolves that roam Fenrir's Hollow.<br><br>

          She formed her bond with Trixie. The great black wolf has a keen sense for the hearts of others, and is fiercely protective of Hawk.</p>
