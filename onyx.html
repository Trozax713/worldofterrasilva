        <h1>Onyx</h1>
        <p>Born to one of the wandering tribes of the Starway Meadows, Onyx was always different. He was born changed, different from his parents and the others in his tribe. Though he was different, he was accepted by the people of the meadows. Passed down through generations, there are legends told of those known as the "Starborn". Blessed by the stars with incredible power, these beings are destined for great things.

          Unfortunately, the son of the chieftain of this tribe saw him as a threat, and wanted the position of his father. In a terrible act of treachery, the son murdered his own father and framed Onyx for the crime. Onyx had to flee to neighboring lands where his appearance was much less accepted, and he was in and out of prisons for much of his life.</p>
